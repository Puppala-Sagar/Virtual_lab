        <h3>INTRODUCTION:</h3>
        <p>
            A laser diode is a laser where the active medium is a semiconductor similar to that found in a
            light-emitting diode.<br/>
            The most common and practical type of laser diode is formed from a p-n junction and powered by
            injected electric current. <br/>
            These devices are sometimes referred to as injection laser diodes to distinguish them from (optically)
            pumped laser diodes, <br/>
            which are more easily produced in the laboratory.

        <h3>THEORY:</h3>
        <p>
            A laser diode, like many other semiconductor devices, is formed by doping a very thin layer on the
            surface of a crystal wafer.<br/>
            The crystal is doped to produce an n-type region and a p-type region, one above the other, resulting
            in a p-n junction, or diode. <br/>
            When an electron and a hole are present in the same region, they may recombine or "annihilate" with
            the result being spontaneous emission â€” i.e.,<br/>
            the electron may reoccupy the energy state of the hole, emitting a photon with energy equal to the
            difference between the electron and hole states involved.<br/>
            (In a conventional semiconductor junction diode, the energy released from the recombination of
            electrons and holes is carried away as photons, i.e., lattice vibrations, rather than as photons.)<br/>
            Spontaneous emission gives the laser diode below lasing threshold similar properties to an LED.<br/>
            Spontaneous emission is necessary to initiate laser oscillation, but it is one among several sources
            of inefficiency once the laser is oscillating. <br/>
            <br/>
            In the absence of stimulated emission (e.g., lasing) conditions, electrons and holes may coexist in
            proximity to one another,<br/>
            without recombining, for a certain time, termed the "upper-state lifetime" or "recombination time"
            (about a nanosecond for typical diode laser materials), before they recombine.<br/>
            Then a nearby photon with energy equal to the recombination energy can cause recombination by
            stimulated emission. This generates another photon of the same frequency,<br/>
            travelling in the same direction, with the same polarization and phase as the first photon. <br/>
            <br/>
            This means that stimulated emission causes gain in an optical wave (of the correct wavelength) in
            the injection region, <br/>
            and the gain increases as the number of electrons and holes injected across the junction increases.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The spontaneous and stimulated emission processes are vastly more efficient in direct bandgap
            semiconductors than in indirect band-gap semiconductors;<br/>
            therefore silicon is not a common material for laser diodes. As in other lasers, the gain region is
            surrounded with an optical cavity to form a laser.<br/>
            In the simplest form of laser diode, an optical waveguide is made on that crystal surface, such that
            the light is confined to a relatively narrow line.<br/>
            The two ends of the crystal are cleaved to form perfectly smooth, parallel edges, forming a
            Fabry-Perot resonator.<br/>
            Photons emitted into a mode of the waveguide will travel along the waveguide and be reflected several
            times from each end face before they are emitted.<br/>
            As a light wave passes through the cavity, it is amplified by stimulated emission, but light is also
            lost due to absorption and by incomplete reflection from the end facets.<br/>
            Finally, if there is more amplification than loss, the diode begins to "laser".<br/>

        <h3>PROCEDURE:</h3>
        <p>
            1. Connect the Laser diode circuit as per the circuit diagram:<br/>
            2. Slowly increase supply voltage using variable Power supply using coarse and fine knobs. <br/>
            3. Note down current through the laser diode at increasing values of Laser diode voltage of 0.5V,
            1.0V, 1.5V, 2.5 V. <br/>
            4. Do not exceed current limit of 30mA else the laser diode may get damaged.<br/>
            5. Plot a graph of Laser diode voltage v/s Laser diode current.<br/>
